								<h3>Bio</h3>

Also, I'm a core team member for SumVikas, an NGO that aims at Women Empowerment and Education for the under-privileged. I worked on these issues as these are the issues that concern me the most and working towards them provided lot of satisfaction. 
								<br>	Further, I also worked as a Featured Writer for www.sportskeeda.com, India's biggest sporting portal. Most of my articles were reviews and analysis of Football matches and I had an average of 11000 reads per article.
My best attributes are my time-management and leadership skills. Also, I'm a very empathetic listener and like to help out my friends.

								<h3>My best achievement yet...</h3>
								
								
									<div class="container">
								
								<p>I worked as a core team member of Sumvikas, an NGO which generally aims at women empowerment and child education, among other social issues. I was a part of the organising team for a charity event for the 2013 Uttarakhand Floods. During the event, I was involved everywhere, Backstage, Anchoring, Decoration, Refreshments. Our team worked assiduously and we collected significant amount of funds which was used for rehabilitation of the survivors of the disaster. In my opinion, this is my biggest achievement yet as what I did was extremely satisfying and helped people in dire need.

								<h3>Failure</h3>
								<p>When I was in class IX, I got into bad company and was involved in illegal activities like smoking and drinking. I was wasting my life by being nonchalant to the condition I was putting myself through. This went on until the day when I scored 0.5/80 in my class X Math pre-board exam. That day, I sat down to think where my life is going. I thought to myself that if I continue down the same lane, I will end up joining my fatherâ€™s jewellery business (which was the last thing I wanted to do). I knew I was good at Math and yet I scored so low, at that moment, I felt miserable. I knew that I was not tapping into my true potential and that thought was thoroughly disturbing. It made me realize how trackless I had been and also that I needed to change my ways. I concentrated hard on the impending board exams and worked assiduously to score 89.2% in my class X boards. I think that was the moment which increased my seriousness towards life and also made me a realistic person.</p>
